<h2> About me </h2>
<p align="justify">
I am a second year PhD Student at UCSC. My advisor is <a href="https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~sesh/" >Professor C. Seshadhri</a>. Before joining UCSC, I completed my MS in Computer Science at the University of Southern California. Before that, in Spain, I studied at the University of Malaga, where I completed a master in Software Engineering and AI, and a Bachelor in Industrial Engineering. My advisor in the university of Malaga was <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FKCnDbUAAAAJ" >Professor Marlon Nunez</a>.

<p>
My research interests are mostly in Theoretical Computer Science, I am currently working in Subgraph counting and Fine-Grained Complexity.
